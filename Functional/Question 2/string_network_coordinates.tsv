CCK	9606.ENSP00000379472	0.33892307692307694	0.6350000000000001	rgb(255,175,101)	Cholecystokinin-58 desnonopeptide; This peptide hormone induces gall bladder contraction and the release of pancreatic enzymes in the gut. Its function in the brain is not clear. Binding to CCK-A receptors stimulates amylase release from the pancreas, binding to CCK-B receptors stimulates gastric acid secretion.
CCKAR	9606.ENSP00000295589	0.4709230769230769	0.5117391304347827	rgb(255,0,0)	Cholecystokinin receptor type A; Receptor for cholecystokinin. Mediates pancreatic growth and enzyme secretion, smooth muscle contraction of the gall bladder and stomach. Has a 1000-fold higher affinity for CCK rather than for gastrin. It modulates feeding and dopamine-induced behavior in the central and peripheral nervous system. This receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.

It also stimulates smooth muscle contraction and increases blood circulation and water secretion in the stomach and intestine.
GNA11	9606.ENSP00000078429	0.6426153846153847	0.31021739130434783	rgb(0,178,157)	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems. Acts as an activator of phospholipase C.
GNAI1	9606.ENSP00000497260	0.5835384615384617	0.22804347826086957	rgb(0,28,178)	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-1; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades. The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state. Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding. The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal. Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numer [...] 
GNAQ	9606.ENSP00000286548	0.4930769230769231	0.3415217391304348	rgb(178,171,0)	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems. Regulates B-cell selection and survival and is required to prevent B-cell-dependent autoimmunity. Regulates chemotaxis of BM- derived neutrophils and dendritic cells (in vitro) (By similarity). Belongs to the G-alpha family. G(q) subfamily.
GNAS	9606.ENSP00000360141	0.5096923076923077	0.14782608695652175	rgb(101,199,255)	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha isoforms XLas; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers in numerous signaling pathways controlled by G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs). Signaling involves the activation of adenylyl cyclases, resulting in increased levels of the signaling molecule cAMP. GNAS functions downstream of several GPCRs, including beta-adrenergic receptors. XLas isoforms interact with the same set of receptors as GNAS isoforms (By similarity).
GNB1	9606.ENSP00000367872	0.5983076923076924	0.558695652173913	rgb(150,101,255)	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(T) subunit beta-1; Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
