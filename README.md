# Protein-Informatics-Project
Analyzing the integrity of CCK1R as well as the impact of mutations in regards to the clinical and pathophysiological implications.
Start with the main Word document.
It contains all the steps, documentation, code and example output you will need to follow along.
Many of the generated files, input files and output files were too large to attach to the Word document directly.
I have uploaded the files into their respective folders by question, as denoted in the Word document.
For question 3 there are 3 mutations that are being analyzed. Like above, the respective files are placed under the folder, "Question 3", in a sub folder named after the mutation.
This project was conducted for my Protein Informatics class at Johns Hopkins University in my Biotechnology Masters of Science Program with a Bioinformatics Concentration.
